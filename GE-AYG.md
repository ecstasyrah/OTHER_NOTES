### Energy
  >  as the capacity to do work

 ### Energy Poverty
> **Lack of access to modern energy services**
> 
> a situation where the **well-being of large numbers of people** in developing countries and some people in developed countries is **negatively affected by very low consumption of energy**, the use of dirty or polluting fuels, and excessive time spent collecting fuel to meet basic needs.
>
> focuses solely on the issue of affordability.

 <summary>Energy and Its Nature</summary>

  # Forms of Energy
 
  ## Potential Energy
> **stored energy**
     
  - **Chemical Energy**
     - bonds of atoms and molecules of matter. Energy responsible for holding these particles together.
     -  stored chemical energy include, but not limited to, the food we eat, biomass, petroleum products, and natural gas.
  - **Elastic Energy**
    - stored energy in objects by the **application of a force**.
    - *Compressed springs and stretched rubbers** are some of the examples of elastic energy.

  - **Nuclear Energy**
    - energy stored in the nucleus of an atom and binds it together. \
    -  mass is converted into huge amounts of energy that follows **Einstein’s equation E = mc2**.
  - **Gravitational potential energy**
    - associated with the position or place of reference.
    - a **rock resting at the top of a hill** contains gravitational potential energy because of its position. **Hydropower, such as water in the reservoir behind a dam**, is another example of this form of energy.
   
  ## Kinetic Energy 
  > energy in **motion**— the motion of waves, electrons, atoms, molecules, substances, and objects.1

  - **Electrical Energy**
    - movement of electrons
    - **Lighting**

  - **Radiant energy**
    - electromagnetic energy that travels in transverse waves.
    - It includes visible light, x-rays, gamma rays, and radio waves.
    -  **Solar energy** is an example of radiant energy.

  - **Thermal energy**
    - heat
    - The faster molecules and atoms move, the more energy they possess, and the hotter they become.
    - **Geothermal energy** is an example of thermal energy.
   
  - **Mechanical energy or motive energy**
    - movement of objects and substances from one place to another upon the application of an unbalanced force (Newton’s Laws of Motion).
    -  wind
   
  -  **Sound energy**
    - movement of energy through substances in **longitudinal (compression/rarefaction) waves**
     a force causes an object or substance to vibrate. The energy is transferred through the substance in a wave.

     <summary>Law of Conservation of Energy</summary>
     
  ## Law of Conservation of Energy

  > energy is neither created nor destroyed.
  >
  > When we use energy we just change its form.
  >
  > Energy can change form but the total quantity or amount of energy in the universe remains constant.

**Example**
  - a car engine burns gasoline as we turn on the engine. In the process, we convert the chemical energy in the gasoline into motive or mechanical energy that makes the car move, and also to heat that is why the engine gets hot, and even to sound.

  <details>Sources of Energy</details>

   ### Nonrenewable
   -  include coal, petroleum, natural gas, and uranium.
   -  used to generate electricity, to heat or cool our homes, to fuel our automobiles, and to manufacture products starting from our basic necessities to some luxurious one.
   - cannot be replenished in a short period of time.
   - Example
     - Fossil Fuels; can run out in the coming years

  ### Renewable
  - include biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar, wind, and ocean.
  - supplies are replenished in a short time.
  - We use renewable energy mainly to generate electricity.
  - through nature

> **Question**: Is electricity a renewable or nonrenewable source of energy?

> **Answer**: The answer is neither. Electricity is different from the other sources because it is a secondary form of energy. That means we have to use another energy source to make it.
