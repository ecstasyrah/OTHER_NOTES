 <summary>Energy and Its Nature</summary>

  # Forms of Energy
 
  ## Potential Energy
> **stored energy**
     
  - **Chemical Energy**
     - bonds of atoms and molecules of matter. Energy responsible for holding these particles together.
     -  stored chemical energy include, but not limited to, the food we eat, biomass, petroleum products, and natural gas.
  - **Elastic Energy**
    - stored energy in objects by the **application of a force**.
    - *Compressed springs and stretched rubbers** are some of the examples of elastic energy.

  - **Nuclear Energy**
    - energy stored in the nucleus of an atom and binds it together. \
    -  mass is converted into huge amounts of energy that follows **Einstein’s equation E = mc2**.
  - **Gravitational potential energy**
    - associated with the position or place of reference.
    - a **rock resting at the top of a hill** contains gravitational potential energy because of its position. **Hydropower, such as water in the reservoir behind a dam**, is another example of this form of energy.
   
  ## Kinetic Energy 
  > energy in **motion**— the motion of waves, electrons, atoms, molecules, substances, and objects.1

  - **Electrical Energy**
    - movement of electrons
    - **Lighting**

  - **Radiant energy**
    - electromagnetic energy that travels in transverse waves.
    - It includes visible light, x-rays, gamma rays, and radio waves.
    -  **Solar energy** is an example of radiant energy.

  - **Thermal energy**
    - heat
    - The faster molecules and atoms move, the more energy they possess, and the hotter they become.
    - **Geothermal energy** is an example of thermal energy.
   
  - **Mechanical energy or motive energy**
    - movement of objects and substances from one place to another upon the application of an unbalanced force (Newton’s Laws of Motion).
    -  wind
   
  -  **Sound energy**
    - movement of energy through substances in **longitudinal (compression/rarefaction) waves**
     a force causes an object or substance to vibrate. The energy is transferred through the substance in a wave.

     <summary>Law of Conservation of Energy</summary>
     
  ## Law of Conservation of Energy

  > energy is neither created nor destroyed.
  >
  > When we use energy we just change its form.
  >
  > Energy can change form but the total quantity or amount of energy in the universe remains constant.

**Example**
  - a car engine burns gasoline as we turn on the engine. In the process, we convert the chemical energy in the gasoline into motive or mechanical energy that makes the car move, and also to heat that is why the engine gets hot, and even to sound.

  <summary>Sources of Energy</summary>

   ### Nonrenewable
   -  include coal, petroleum, natural gas, and uranium.
   -  used to generate electricity, to heat or cool our homes, to fuel our automobiles, and to manufacture products starting from our basic necessities to some luxurious one.
   - cannot be replenished in a short period of time.
   - Example
     - Fossil Fuels; can run out in the coming years

  ### Renewable
  - include biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar, wind, and ocean.
  - supplies are replenished in a short time.
  - We use renewable energy mainly to generate electricity.
  - through nature

> **Question**: Is electricity a renewable or nonrenewable source of energy?

> **Answer**: The answer is neither. Electricity is different from the other sources because it is a secondary form of energy. That means we have to use another energy source to make it.

    <summary>Energy Use</summary>

  # Energy Use
  > to benefit from the services enabled by energy.

### Five energy-consuming sectors
- **Industrial sector**
  - facilities and equipment
- **Transportation sector**
  - vehicles that transport people or goods
- **Residential sector**
  - homes and apartments.
- **Commercial sector**
  - offices, malls, stores, schools, hospitals, hotels, warehouses, restaurants, and places of worship, and public assembly.
- **Electric power sector**
  - **primary energy to generate** most of the electricity the other four sectors consume.

# Energy and Power
### Power 
> measured in units of energy per time.


- **British Thermal Unit (BTU)**
  - A unit of energy equal to the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one-pound water by one degree Fahrenheit. It is used in heating and cooling industries.
- **Calorie or small calorie (calorie)**
  -  amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius.
- **Food Calorie, Kilocalorie or large calorie (Cal, kcal, Calorie)**
  - to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius.
- **Joule (J)**
  - smaller quantity of energy than calorie and much smaller than a BTU.
- **Kilowatt Hour (kWh)**
  - the steady production or consumption of one kilowatt of power for a period of one hour.
- **Therm**
  - energy contained in natural gas

### Energy Measurement 
- 1 horsepower = 2,545 BTU/hour / 746 Watts.
- 1 Watts = 1 Joule
- 1 BTU = 1055 Joules (J)
- 1 calorie = 0.003969 BTUs
- 1 Cal = 1000 cal = 4187 J = 3.969 BTUs
- 1 Joule = 0.2388 calories = 0.0009481 BTUs
- 1 kWh = 3413 BTUs = 3600000 J
- 1 therm = 100000 BTUs

  - necessary to maintain life
  - oxygen, food, water, shelter, sleep, etc.
- **Safety needs**
  - health, freedom from war, financial security. freedom from fear, protection from natural phenomena like typhoons, peace and order, etc.
- **Love and belonging needs**
  - needs are typically met by friends, family, and emotional partners
  - love, friendship, affection, trust and acceptance, intimacy, receiving and giving, affiliation and being part of a family

  <summary>Measuring Electricity</summary>

### Measuring Electricity

- **Voltage (V)**
  - pressure that pushes electrons in a circuit
- **Current (I)**
  - electrons flowing between two points having a difference
  - compared to the flow of water
  - Amperes **(A)**
- **Resistance (R)**
  - property that slows the flow of electrons.
  - Ohms **(Ω)**
- **Ohm's Law**
  - if he doubled the voltage, the current also doubled. If he reduced the voltage by half, the current dropped by half.
  - Voltage = Current X Resistance
  - **V = I x R** or **V = A x Ω**
- **Electric Power**
  - rate at which electricity is produced or consumed.
  - measured in Watts **(W)**
  - amount of **electric current flowing** due to an applied voltage
  - power = voltage x current
  - **P = V x I** or **W = V x A**
- **Electrical Energy**
  - introduces the concept of time to electric power.
  - appliance or device consumes can be determined **only if you know how long** (time) it consumes electric power at a specific rate (power)
  - measured in watt-hours **(Wh)**
  - energy = power x time
  - **E = P x t** or **E = W x h = Wh**
 
If you read for five hours with a 100-W light bulb, for example, you would use the formula as follows:

energy = power x time (E = P x t) = 100 W x 5 hour = 500 Wh

One watt-hour is a very small amount of electrical energy. Usually, we measure electric power in larger units called kilowatt-hours (kWh) or 1,000 watt-hours (kilo = thousand). A kilowatt-hour is a unit that utilities use when billing most customers.

If the cost of energy is Php 10.00 per kWh, to calculate the cost of reading with a 100-W light bulb for five hours, you would change first the watt-hours into kilowatt-hours, then multiply the kilowatt-hours used by the cost per kilowatt-hour, as shown below:

500 Wh x = 0.5 kWh

0.5 kWh x Php 10.00/kWh = Php 5.00

Therefore, it would cost about five pesos to read for five hours with a 100-W light bulb
